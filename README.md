# -Stress-Recognition
Welcome to the processing of a file created to detect stress in photo images using a neural network.
For the system to work properly, you need to specify certain details, namely:
1. Set a characteristic dataset or some other depending on your preferences.
2. In the lb.py program itself, you should change the path to the installed dataset.
3. Continue to study the characteristic model, but now it is trained and produces satisfactory results.
4. There are two types of programs: iner.beta.py and inter.alfa.py. These programs work, but they have a different system for displaying results.

I hope these instructions will help you in fruitful and satisfactory work with this system. I wish you success.
